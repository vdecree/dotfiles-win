# My Dot Files for Windows

This repo largly taken from the great [Christian Lempa](https://github.com/ChristianLempa/dotfiles-win). I have implemented many of his basic configurations for my Windows that have vastly improved it's aesthetics and efficiency.

### Useful Links:

[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)

This is a package manager for Windows and it's very easy to get setup. I needed this for starship. 

[Starship](https://starship.rs/)

A cross-shell prompt. Part of making powershell look god damn hawt. 

[Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)

Some great fonts for text editors and the command prompt. You'll need this for these configurations. Specifically 'Hack Nerd Font' which contains most the icons used. 

> **note**
> I found that I encountered errors when initially installed starship because I needed to set `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process` in order to avoid problems loading the starship config file. This is covered in the Chocolatey documents. 

I will update this as I customize things more. I advise you check out Christian's YouTube channel, some very informative content to be consumed.
